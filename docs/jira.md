# Jira Integration

## Project
- **Key:** `WPB`
- **Board:** https://procyoncreative.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/WPB/boards
- **REST API base:** https://procyoncreative.atlassian.net/rest/api/3

## MCP Server
- **Server:** `procyon_atlassian` (SSE) — registered in `.mcp.json`
- **URL:** https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
- Tools are available as `mcp__procyon_atlassian__*` once Claude Code re-loads the project.

## Auth
- **Email:** set as the `JIRA_EMAIL` repo secret and used by MCP
- **API token:** generate at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
- The token is required as the `JIRA_API_TOKEN` repo secret. Do not commit it. For local scripts, source it from `.env` (which is gitignored).

## Workflow Rules
- **No work without a ticket.** Every branch must reference a `WPB-NNN` Jira ticket. If one doesn't exist, create it first via `/jira-ticket create` (or in the Jira UI) before opening the branch.
- **Branch name format:** `WPB-NNN-short-description` (e.g. `WPB-42-add-login-form`).
- **Ticket requirements:**
  - **Hours estimate** (Story Points or Original Estimate field — pick one and be consistent).
  - **Acceptance Criteria** including the mandatory line: **"Use Red/Green TDD"**.
- **PR opens → ticket moves to QA.** Handled automatically by `.github/workflows/jira.yml`.
- **PR merges → ticket moves to Done.** Same workflow.

## CI Workflow
The `.github/workflows/jira.yml` action:
1. Syncs ticket metadata onto the PR (comment, labels) on every PR push.
2. Transitions to `QA` when a PR is opened or reopened.
3. Transitions to `Done` when a PR is merged.

## Quick Reference
- Create / edit a ticket: `/jira-ticket`
- Move current branch's ticket to QA manually: comment `/jira-qa` on the PR (if `jira-action-man` rules are configured) or use the MCP.
